## Update, 2021-07-12

I have made progress comparing four tools for "fast mapping of nodes and connections", with narrated screen recordings of me using each tool to map a number of nodes.

- Scapple (34 minutes) [00:00:00]
- Diagrams.net (54 minutes) [00:34:19]
- Miro (14 minutes) [01:28:26]
- Whimsical (10 minutes) [01:43:07]

"Fast mapping of nodes and connections" means that I want to come up with a bunch of related concepts, put them down on a board, and then be able to rearrange them in 2D space, and draw connecting lines between them.

For this purpose, I am not interested in highly produced map output, but rather, something that maps the concept space in a way that starts to create some organization and narrative backbone for me and others to be able to see.

I am publishing the screen recordings on YouTube as one long video with chapter marks.

I had hoped to have a shorter, more summarized video, but as I was recording the video, it was tempting to go into a fair bit of detail, and to play around a bit with each tool.  I think it's valuable to see the little mistakes and missteps I made as I used each tool; in a review like this, seeing it in actual use is a large part of the value, even though it adds to the overall time it takes to watch the video.

I am not sure how to proceed here; I would still like to have a summarized version, but I'm not sure it's worth my production time.  We'll see what unfolds.

## Qualitative Comparisons Between Four Tools

I am biased by being a long-time user of Scapple and Diagrams.net (formerly known as Draw.io).  I have already absorbed much of the learning curve for each of them over a number of years of experience working with them.

### Scapple

[Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview) has a relatively low learning curve.  Diagrams.net has somewhat higher learning curve, but for nodes and connections, you don't need much of its capabilities (and rather, for this use case, you mostly need to learn how to stay away from some its power that you might accidentally trip into).

Scapple is a single-player, desktop app.  As such, it is fast and responsive.  It is a little idiosyncratic to learn, but as a focused tool for quick mapping, it really shines with this use case.

### Diagrams.net

[Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) is a multi-player, web-based app.  Even though it runs in the browser, it still feels fast and responsive.  It's a more complex tool, used for making much more complicated diagrams with different kinds of shapes and connections.  It's still useful for nodes and connections, but you have to contend with some of the power features that aren't used for simple diagramming.

### Miro

[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a multi-player, web-based app.  It always feels slow and less responsive to me.  Using it for nodes and connections is overkill; it has many other collaborative layout tools to bring to bear.  My main problem with Miro for this use case is that I could not figure out how to make connected rays radiate well from the center of a node, which makes a visual mess.  I quickly abandoned Miro for this use case.

### Whimsical

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) is a multi-player, web-based app.  It feels easy to pick up, self-documents reasonably well, and makes attractive nodes and lines, although line labelling isn't by default as nice as Scapple.  It's a little sluggish and less responsive than I like.  Between that, and using it last, I stopped before finishing the sample diagram.

## Conclusions

For single-player use (or for multiple people watching a single person map via screenshare, and providing input, another good modality), Scapple is my strong choice.

Diagrams.net has a steeper learning curve, and it's a little more powerful and more clunky.  Since I'm through much of the learning curve, it's still not too bad.  So for single-player use, I can use Diagrams.net.  For multi-player use, I worry that the extra complexity of the tool might make it hard to learn quickly, so it might not be a tool I turn to for casual multi-player sessions.

On the plus side, Diagrams.net can save the document data inside a PNG export file, so it's possible to distribute one file which is viewable as an image, *and* carries the fully-editable diagram within it.  This is a superb feature from Diagrams.net for sharing an easily editable diagram.

Whimsical feels slower to use, but it's more approachable by someone trying the tool for the first time.  I think I can coach around some of the gotchas more easily, as well.  For these reasons, I think I will try Whimsical for multi-player sessions, instead of Diagrams.net.

Miro completely fell down for me on making visually coherent diagrams, due to the way it positions connecting lines.  It may be that the way I was using it was idiosyncratic, and I can learn some way to make it look better (please let me know if so!), but it is currently disqualified on this factor alone.  Like Whimsical, it feels sluggish to work with, so that's another strike against it, that Diagrams.net and Scapple don't have.

## Addendum

### General Information

- See "[The Theory Underlying Concept Maps](https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps) and How to Construct and Use Them". Written about concept mapping, but has excellent overall discussion about mapping
